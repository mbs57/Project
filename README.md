# University Organization Management System
## Course Title: Software Engineering
## Course Code: CSE305
## Project proposal: University Organization Management System
- ## Introduction
The "University Organization Management System" is a user-centric platform facilitating streamlined management and interaction for university organizations. It empowers organizations to showcase their mission and activities, simplifies membership applications, and supports diverse organization types. Administrators maintain control over user accounts and configurations. The system promotes community engagement through event management, RSVP functionality, and notifications. Its responsive design ensures accessibility across devices, making it a centralized hub for effective communication and collaboration within the university community.
- ## Features And Functionalities
### 1. User Roles
#### 1. Administrator:
   - Responsible for overall system management and configuration.
   - Has the authority to add, modify, or delete organizations and their information.
